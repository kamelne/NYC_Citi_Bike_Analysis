# NYC Citibike Analysis
## Overview 
Looking at existing data of Citibike in NYC in the month of August, we are trying to create a business proposal to start a similar service in Des Moines.

## Results
The visualizations can be seen in the tableau story linked below:

 - On the first page you can see the total number of rides taken along with breakdown of percentage of subscribers and gender. 
 - The second page shows the number of trips by trip duration
 - The third page shows the number of trips by trip duration separated by gender
 - the forth shows a heat map of trip starts by hour and day of the week
 - the fifth shows a heat map of trip starts by hour and day of the week separated by gender
 - the sixth shows a heat map of the number of trips taken each day of the week by gender and usertype

## Summary
Based of the results the highest target of customers would be those who are looking to get to and from work. Two additional visualizations I would suggest are average length of trip by hour of week day and average age of rides by gender and week day.
